					<p>In Hearthstone players collect virtual cards and put them into decks.  They then battle with those decks against other players from all across the world. </p>
					<p>Cards are collected by purchasing card packs using either real money or in-game gold.  Card packs contain five random cards so you never know what you are going to get.</p>
					<p>Matches usually take around ten minutes to play out but this depends on the kinds of decks used and the playerâ€™s style of play.  A single turn can take no longer than ninety seconds</p>
					<p>There are a number of modes players can play in, one such mode is ranked.  In ranked play every game contributes to the players rank.  At end of each month all ranks are reset and players who participated receive rewards.</p>
